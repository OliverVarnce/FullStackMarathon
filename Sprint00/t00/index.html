    <h2>What makes a superhero?</h2>
    <p>A superhero or superheroine is a stock character that possesses abilities beyond those of ordinary people, who typically uses his or her powers to help the world become a better place, or is dedicated to protecting the public, and fighting crime. Superhero fiction is the genre of fiction that is centered on such characters,[1] especially in American comic books since the 1930s (and later Hollywood films), as well as in Japanese media (including kamishibai, tokusatsu, manga, anime, and video games) since the 1930s.</p>
    <p>Superheroes come from a wide array of different backgrounds and origins. <b>Some superheroes (for example, Batman and Iron Man) derive their status from advanced technology</b> they create and use, while others (such as Superman and Spider-Man) possess non-human or superhuman biology or study and practice magic to achieve their abilities (such as Zatanna and Doctor Strange).[2][3][4] While the Dictionary.com definition of "superhero" is "a figure, especially in a comic strip or cartoon, endowed with superhuman powers and usually portrayed as fighting evil or crime",[5] the longstanding Merriam-Webster dictionary gives the definition as "a fictional hero having extraordinary or superhuman powers; also: an exceptionally skillful or successful person.</p>
